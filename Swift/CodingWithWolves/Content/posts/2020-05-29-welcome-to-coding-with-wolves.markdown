Hi everyone !

I have been wondering a while about whether I should start a blog or not.

`Is what I know worth sharing ?`
or even
`Will it be interesting enough ?`
is something that might sound familiar to you if you ever thought about starting a blog too.

After a lot of thinking I finally decided to go for it.

Though I specialized in Swift I will try to give some personal feedback about coding in general, not only about Swift.

Hope you will find what you were looking for by reading this blog.

And if you ever want to get in touch, feel free to do so on social media, you can find my info in the footer of this blog.

Cheers.
