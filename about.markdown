Hi !

My name is Yoan Smit and I have been coding for the past five years.

I am currently working at [BENEXT](https://www.benextcompany.com), a tech company based in Paris, France.

I started this blog to share with others what I wished I had known earlier, from general advice about coding to book reviews.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/YoanSmit) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/naxyoh).

By the way, the logo in the navigation bar was designed by Alice Tapia, check her [portfolio](https://www.alicetapia.com/) if you want to see more of her awesome work.

Cheers.
